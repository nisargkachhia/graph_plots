# Time Complexity Analysis and Merge Sort

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the runtime complexity of a function, fitting a polynomial curve to the data, and implementing the **Merge Sort** algorithm. The project is divided into two main tasks:

- Includes a test function to run Merge Sort on the array `[5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6]`
