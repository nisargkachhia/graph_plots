# Time Complexity Analysis and Merge Sort Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the runtime complexity of a function, fitting a polynomial curve to the data, and implementing the **Merge Sort** algorithm. The project is divided into two main tasks:

1. **Runtime Analysis of a Nested Loop Function:**
   - Analyze the time complexity of a nested loop function `f(n)`.
   - Time the function for various values of `n`.
   - Fit a polynomial curve to the timing data and determine the time complexity.
   - Find the approximate value of `nâ‚€` where the polynomial fit starts to diverge from the timing data.

2. **Merge Sort Implementation:**
   - Implement the Merge Sort algorithm.
   - Test Merge Sort on an example array.
